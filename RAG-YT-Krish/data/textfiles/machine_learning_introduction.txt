Machine Learning Introduction
=============================

1. What is Machine Learning?
   - Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

2. Key Concept
   - The idea is to let computers automatically learn patterns and make predictions or decisions based on data.

3. Types of Machine Learning
   a) Supervised Learning
      - The model learns from labeled data (input-output pairs).
      - Examples: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks.
      - Use cases: Spam detection, price prediction, medical diagnosis.

   b) Unsupervised Learning
      - The model learns from unlabeled data by finding structure or patterns.
      - Examples: K-Means Clustering, PCA, Autoencoders.
      - Use cases: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection.

   c) Reinforcement Learning
      - The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback (rewards or penalties).
      - Examples: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
      - Use cases: Robotics, game playing, self-driving cars.
