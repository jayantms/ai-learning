They \\nwere the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything \\nstrange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such \\nnonsense. \\nMr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which \\nmade drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, \\nalthough he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was \\nthin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, \\nwhich came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning \\nover garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a \\nsmall son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer \\nboy anywhere. \\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a \\nsecret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover \\nit. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about \\nthe Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t \\nmet for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn’t \\nhave a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband \\nwere as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys \\nshuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters \\narrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a \\nsmall son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was \\nanother good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t \\nwant Dudley mixing with a child like that. \\nWhen Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey Tuesday \\nour story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to \\nsuggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be hap-\\npening all over the country.

He got into his car and backed out of number four’s \\ndrive. \\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign  \\nof something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr \\nDursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked his head \\naround to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner \\nof Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could  \\nhe have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. \\nMr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr \\nDursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the \\ncat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive \\n– no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr \\nDursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his  \\nmind. As he drove towards town he thought of nothing except a \\nlarge order of drills he was hoping to get that day. \\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by \\nsomething else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he \\ncouldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely \\ndressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t bear \\npeople who dressed in funny clothes – the get-ups you saw on \\nyoung people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He \\ndrummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a \\nhuddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whis-\\npering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was enraged to see that a \\ncouple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older \\nthan he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of \\nhim! But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some \\nsilly stunt – these people were obviously collecting for something \\n… yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on, and a few minutes \\nlater, Mr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind  \\nback on drills. \\nMr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office \\non the ninth floor.

In his anger he seemed to fill the whole \\nhut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. \\n‘Do you mean ter tell me,’ he growled at the Dursleys, ‘that this \\nboy – this boy! – knows nothin’ abou’ – about ANYTHING?’ \\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, \\nafter all, and his marks weren’t bad. \\n‘I know some things,’ he said. ‘I can, you know, do maths and \\nstuff.’ \\nBut Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, ‘About our world, I \\nmean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world.’ \\n‘What world?’ \\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode. \\n‘DURSLEY!’ he boomed. \\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something \\nthat sounded like ‘Mimblewimble’.

Harry, who had expected \\nmore marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passage-\\nway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downwards and \\nthere were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled \\nand a small cart came hurtling up the tracks towards them. They \\nclimbed in – Hagrid with some difficulty – and were off. \\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. \\nHarry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, \\nleft, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its \\nown way, because Griphook wasn’t steering. \\nHarry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept \\nthem wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end \\nof a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late \\n– they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where \\nhuge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. \\n‘I never know,’ Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \\n‘what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?’ \\n‘Stalagmite’s got an “m” in it,’ said Hagrid. ‘An’ don’ ask me \\nquestions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.’ \\nHe did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside \\na small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean \\nagainst the wall to stop his knees trembling. \\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came bil-\\nlowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds  \\nof gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. \\n‘All yours,’ smiled Hagrid. \\nAll Harry’s – it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have \\nknown about this or they’d have had it from him faster than \\nblinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost \\nthem to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune \\nbelonging to him, buried deep under London. \\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. \\n‘The gold ones are Galleons,’ he explained. ‘Seventeen silver \\nSickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy \\nenough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll \\nkeep the rest safe for yeh.’ He turned to Griphook. ‘Vault seven \\nhundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?’ \\n‘One speed only,’ said Griphook. \\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering speed.

Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again … Oak, \\nsixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?’ \\n‘It was, sir, yes,’ said Hagrid. \\n‘Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half \\nwhen you got expelled?’ said Mr Ollivander, suddenly stern. \\n‘Er – yes, they did, yes,’ said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. ‘I’ve still \\ngot the pieces, though,’ he added brightly. \\n‘But you don’t use them?’ said Mr Ollivander sharply. \\n‘Oh, no, sir,’ said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his \\npink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. \\n‘Hmmm,’ said Mr Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \\n‘Well, now – Mr Potter. Let me see.’ He pulled a long tape measure \\nwith silver markings out of his pocket. ‘Which is your wand arm?’ \\n‘Er – well, I’m right-handed,’ said Harry. \\n‘Hold out your arm. That’s it.’ He measured Harry from shoul-\\nder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit \\nand round his head. As he measured, he said, ‘Every Ollivander \\nwand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr Potter. We \\nuse unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of \\ndragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two \\nunicorns, dragons or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, \\nyou will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.’ \\nHarry suddenly realised that the tape measure, which was meas-\\nuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr \\nOllivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. \\n‘That will do,’ he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a \\nheap on the floor. ‘Right then, Mr Potter. Try this one. Beechwood \\nand dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it \\nand give it a wave.’ \\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a'),\n",

As a surprise for Harry, they had \\npainted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined.  \\nIt said Potter for President and Dean, who was good at drawing, \\nhad done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione  \\nhad performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed \\ndifferent colours. \\nMeanwhile, in the changing rooms, Harry and the rest of the \\nteam were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin \\nwould be playing in green). \\nWood cleared his throat for silence. \\n‘OK, men,’ he said. \\n‘And women,’ said Chaser Angelina Johnson. \\n‘And women,’ Wood agreed. ‘This is it.’ \\n‘The big one,’ said Fred Weasley. \\n‘The one we’ve all been waiting for,’ said George. \\n‘We know Oliver’s speech by heart,’ Fred told Harry. ‘We were \\nin the team last year.’ \\n‘Shut up, you two,’ said Wood. ‘This is the best team \\nGryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know it.’ \\nHe glared at them all as if to say, ‘Or else.’ \\n‘Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.’ \\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the changing room and, \\nhoping his knees weren’t going to give way, walked on to the pitch \\nto loud cheers. \\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the \\npitch, waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand. \\n‘Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,’ she said, once they \\nwere all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be \\nspeaking particularly to the Slytherin captain, Marcus Flint, a  \\nfifth-year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll  \\nblood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering \\nbanner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd.  \\nHis heart skipped. He felt braver. \\n‘Mount your brooms, please.’ \\nHarry clambered on to his Nimbus Two Thousand.'),\n",

Move along, all of you.’ \\nMalfoy, Crabbe and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scatter-\\ning needles everywhere and smirking. \\n‘I’ll get him,’ said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s back, ‘one \\nof these days, I’ll get him –’ \\n‘I hate them both,’ said Harry, ‘Malfoy and Snape.’ \\n‘Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,’ said Hagrid. ‘Tell yeh \\nwhat, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.’ \\nSo Harry, Ron and Hermione followed Hagrid and his tree off to \\nthe Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor \\nFlitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations. \\n‘Ah, Hagrid, the last tree – put it in the far corner, would you?’ \\nThe Hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe \\nhung all around the walls and no fewer than twelve towering \\nChristmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny \\nicicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.'),\n",

He came back a minute later with a pile of \\nbooks in his arms and slammed them down on the table. \\n‘Dragons!’ he whispered. ‘Hagrid was looking up stuff about \\ndragons!

The Weasley twins and Lee \\nJordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was bask-\\ning in the warm shallows. \\n‘No more revision,’ Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the \\ngrass. ‘You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before \\nwe find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.’ \\nHarry was rubbing his forehead. \\n‘I wish I knew what this means!’ he burst out angrily. ‘My scar \\nkeeps hurting – it’s happened before, but never as often as this.’ \\n‘Go to Madam Pomfrey,’ Hermione suggested. \\n‘I’m not ill,’ said Harry. ‘I think it’s a warning … it means danger’s \\ncoming …’ \\nRon couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot. \\n‘Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as \\nDumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape \\nfound out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off \\nonce, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play \\nQuidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.’ \\nHarry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that \\nthere was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. \\nWhen he tried to explain this, Hermione said, ‘That’s just the \\nexams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my \\nTransfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.’ \\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything \\nto do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter towards the \\nschool across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. \\nHagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would \\nnever betray Dumbledore.
