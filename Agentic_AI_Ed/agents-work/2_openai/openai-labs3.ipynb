       "In 2025, several advanced AI agent frameworks have emerged, enhancing the development and deployment of intelligent, autonomous systems. Notable among these are:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Agent Lightning**: A flexible framework enabling reinforcement learning-based training of large language models (LLMs) for any AI agent. It decouples agent execution from training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents and supporting complex interactions like multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03680?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF)**: This framework leverages LLMs and mathematical principles to design adaptive AI agents capable of real-time parameter reconfiguration. It defines a multidimensional parameter space to capture agent behaviors, supporting scalable, dynamic, and ethical AI applications. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01581?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **GoalfyMax**: A protocol-driven multi-agent system that introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent communication layer based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It incorporates an Experience Pack architecture for structured knowledge retention and continual learning, enhancing adaptability and coordination in complex tasks. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09497?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Cognitive Kernel-Pro**: An open-source, multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development of advanced AI agents. It focuses on curating high-quality training data and novel strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting, achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source agents. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00414?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "Additionally, major tech companies have introduced their own AI agent frameworks:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **OpenAI Agents SDK**: A lightweight Python framework released in March 2025, focusing on creating multi-agent workflows with comprehensive tracing and guardrails. It is compatible with over 100 different LLMs and offers detailed monitoring and debugging capabilities.

       "\n",
       "- **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**: Announced in April 2025, this modular framework integrates with Google's ecosystem, including Gemini and Vertex AI. It supports hierarchical agent compositions and requires minimal code for efficient development.
